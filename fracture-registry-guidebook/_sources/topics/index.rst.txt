Points of interest
==================

While a lot of Fracreg will be familiar to anyone who's worked on an MRS
registry, some parts of it require a bit of explanation. In the sections below
we'll focus on areas of Fracreg which are particularly important, difficult, or
otherwise need clarification that can't be easily derived from the code itself.
I'll try to avoid going into too much detail on the topics, preferring instead
to be brief and referring you to the code after some orientation.
